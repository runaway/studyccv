I've cut the stable branch off unstable yesterday, and a r0.2-rc branch as well.
This marks the 0.2 version of ccv finally here.

ccv 0.2 expects to be a bug-fix release, and should address several "obvious"
problems have after the first release. Thus, two important issues get addressed
in this release:

1). thread-safety. The first release version of ccv is not thread-safe when
enabled the application-wide cache, because access and mutation on this cache is
not thread-safe. In this release, the application-wide cache becomes thread
local, thus, have its thread-safety now.

2). read in-memory data. It is always possible to create a ccv_dense_matrix_t
yourself and fill it out with in-memory data, but the lacking of canonical way
to read in-memory data into ccv seems problematic in the community. In this
release, ccv_read will take more options, and one of them is to read in-memory
self-describe data (such as in-memory JPEG or PNG), another is to read RGB plain
formatted bytes directly. [read more](/lib/ccv-io/).

In 0.2, DPM finally can train multi-components model (a.k.a. the "real" mixture
model), and I've included a car model for you to try out:

Largely still *work-in-progress*, the SWT included a swtcreate tool for you to
tune SWT parameters to fit your use-cases, and the text segregation gets better
too:

The last 3 months have been "bumpy" for me, and after the summer school in
Berkeley, I should be able to release ccv more regularly. Hope you enjoy.
