In the next 2 days, I will cut a new branch from unstable to replace current stable
branch, and announcing 0.2 release.

0.2 supposes to be a bug-fix release, thus, you won't expect a significant new
features in it, but whatever, here is what's new:

1). thread-safety by having application-wide cache thread-local;

2). support ccv_read from memory;

3). preliminary MSER implementation;

4). more concise documentation and improvements on SWT;

5). DPM supports real mixture model creation, with new car.m model in ./samples/;

It has been 3 months since the last release, and hopefully, after this release,
the upcoming schedule will be more regularized.
