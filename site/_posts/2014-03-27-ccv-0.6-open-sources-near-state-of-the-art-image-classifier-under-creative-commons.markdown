In previous posts, I mentioned that the even numbered release will be bugfixes. However, 0.6 is a bit different.

For the past one and half year, deep learning, particularly deep convolutional neural network based image classification made waves in the vision community. For a library aiming at providing state-of-the-art implementations, it would be frustrating to not having a competent image classifier implemented after over a year the ground-breaking work published. In the meantime, there are a few open source libraries provided complete ([Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)) / incomplete ([OverFeat](http://cilvr.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=software:overfeat:start), [cuda-convnet](http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/)) implementations of the said image classifier. However, all of them are focusing on research related activities (see their licenses: [1](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/getting_pretrained_models.html), [2](https://github.com/sermanet/OverFeat/blob/master/LICENSE)). Thus, for the past 5 months, I've been working on an image classifier in ccv with deep convolutional neural network.

This version's ccv distributed a image classifier that is trained with ILSVRC 2010 data set of 1000 classes, with top-1 missing rate at 36.83% and top-5 missing rate at 16.25%, thus, close to the state-of-the-art image classifier (Clarifai in ILSVRC 2013 gets top-5 missing rate at 11.19%: <http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2013/results.php>, the 16.25% top-5 missing rate is reproduced with ILSVRC 2010 test data set, which is known to be much less challenging). [See more about this image classifier](/doc/doc-convnet).

The license for these data models (the said image classifier, and the pedestrian detectors, the car detector, the face detector) provided in ccv ./samples is changed from [BSD 3-clause license](https://raw.github.com/liuliu/ccv/unstable/COPYING) to [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) in hope that this more clarified license will help the adoption of these trained data models.

As always, the new image classifier is available through ccv's [RESTful interface](/doc/doc-http) at http://localhost:3350/convnet/classify. You can also play with ccv at <http://docomputersdream.org/>

Since this version is an anomaly in terms of release cycle, next two versions of ccv will be devoted to bugfixes and performance improvement. There is also a plan to enter ILSVRC 2014 and publish results on FDDB and LFW for the sake of keeping ccv's implementation fresh and competitive.

Other changes / bugfixes in ccv 0.6:

1). Moved from hand-written configure script to autoconf (which still provides link / flag information);

2). <http://ci.libccv.org/> is online to monitor builds for unstable branch and free of static analyzer reports: <http://ci.libccv.org/analyze/>;

3). Fixed a bug in ./serve/ccv that returned HTTP header claims to be 1.1 but never keeps the connection open;

4). RESTful interface for SWT added Tesseract (OCR) support;

5). Fixed ICF implementation problem with non-standard float point representation;

6). Fixed multi-thread bug with fftw3 usage;
