<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>I set to build ccv with a minimalism inspiration. That was back in 2010, out
of the frustration with the computer vision library then I was using, ccv
was meant to be a much easier to deploy, simpler organized code with a bit
caution with dependency hygiene. The simplicity and minimalistic nature at
then, made it much easier to integrate into any server-side deployment
environments.</p>
<h2>Portable and Embeddable</h2>
<p>Fast forward to now, the world is quite different from then, but ccv adapts
pretty well in this new, mobile-first environment. It now runs on Mac OSX,
Linux, FreeBSD, Windows*, iPhone, iPad, Android, Raspberry Pi. In fact,
anything that has a proper C compiler probably can run ccv. The majority
(with notable exception of convolutional networks, which requires a BLAS
library) of ccv will just work with no compilation flags or dependencies.</p>
<h2>Modern Computer Vision Algorithms</h2>
<p>One core concept of ccv development is <b>application driven</b>. Thus, ccv ends
up implementing a handful state-of-art algorithms. It includes a close to
state-of-the-art image classifier, a state-of-the-art frontal face detector,
reasonable collection of object detectors for pedestrians and cars, a useful
text detection algorithm, a long-term general object tracking algorithm,
and the long-standing feature point extraction algorithm.</p>
<h2>Clean Interface with Cached Image Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Many computer vision tasks nowadays consist of quite a few preprocessing
layers: image pyramid generation, color space conversion etc. These potentially
redundant operations cannot be easily eliminated within a mature API. ccv
provides a built-in cache mechanism that, while maintains a clean function
interface, effectively does transparent cache for you.

<p>For computer vision community, there is no shortage of good algorithms, good
implementation is what it lacks of. After years, we stuck in between either the
high-performance, battle-tested but old algorithm implementations, or the new,
shining but Matlab algorithms. ccv is my take on this problem, hope you enjoy
it.</p>
